[Sean Cribbs](http://seancribbs.com), lead developer of Radiant CMS and co-founder of [Lowdown](http://lowdownapp.com) gave a great talk this month called Story-Driven Development with Cucumber. [Sean](http://twitter.com/seancribbs) gives a great tutorial on how Cucumber works as well as the benefits that go along with story-driven development. I've posted the talk as well as his slides here for anyone who wasn't able to make it or would like to see it again. Sorry for the *dark* video; It's hard keeping it dark enough for a projector while bright enough to film our speakers.

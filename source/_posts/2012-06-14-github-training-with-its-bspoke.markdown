Though not officially part of the clt.rb, our very own [Jim Van Fleet](http://jimvanfleet.com) organized an Advanced Git Training session with the Github guys, hosted graciously by [Classic Graphics](http://knowclassic.com/). Tim Berglund (@tlberglund) and Adam Roben (@aroben) taught about a bunch of advanced and underused features of git as well as showing us how to get our Windows-only friends using source control with [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/). More importantly, Github hosted a drinkup at the [Flying Saucer](http://www.beerknurd.com/) immediately afterward.

You've reached the home of the Charlotte Ruby Users Group or cltrb for short. This site is currently a work in progress and is actively being developed by cltrb.

We're a group of local Ruby enthusiasts who try to get together twice a month for lightning talks or a hack night. Check out our [meetup page](http://ruby.meetup.com/136) or [follow us on twitter](http://twitter.com/cltrb) for more info.
